## Overview

The challenge was to make a rating card, allowing customers to rate their experience with a given website

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

This challenge was harder than I thought it would be, simply because I've recently finished a class on Javascript, and built some pretty cool things with that class, however not having a lot of "My own" practice until now, it goes to show how important building your own projects from scratch is. I first made both of the layouts, and did the mobile sizes, and then proceeded to the Javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Like stated in the process, I learned how important it is, to do your own projects, step by step video guides are great for showing you how to do certain things, but unless you are getting a lot of your own practice in (Which is what I am planning on doing now) it won't stick very well, and some pretty simple things become harder to accomplish

### Continued development

I plan on finishing as many frontend mentor projects as I can to get as much practice in as I can.
